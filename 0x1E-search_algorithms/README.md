Search Algorithms Readme

This repository, "alx-low_level_programming," contains implementations of various search algorithms in C. The first task, "0. Linear search," requires the implementation of a function that performs a linear search on an array of integers. The function, int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value), returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the array. The search progress is printed for each comparison. The second task, "1. Binary search," involves creating a function, int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value), that performs binary search on a sorted array. Similar to the linear search, the function prints the array being searched for each iteration. Subsequent tasks explore the time and space complexities of linear and binary searches in different scenarios. Task "2. Big O #0" focuses on the time complexity of a linear search, while "3. Big O #1" examines the space complexity of an iterative linear search. Tasks "4. Big O #2" and "5. Big O #3" analyze the time and space complexities of binary search, respectively. Finally, task "6. Big O #4" evaluates the space complexity of a given function, int **allocate_map(int n, int m), which dynamically allocates a 2D array. The repository provides a comprehensive understanding of these search algorithms and their respective complexities.
