The More Singly Linked Lists project provides a few enhancements over a standard singly linked list implementation. These enhancements include:

Circular Linked List: In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node instead of pointing to None. This means that you can traverse the entire list by starting at any node and continuing until you reach the node where you started.
Doubly Linked List: In a doubly linked list, each node has a pointer to the next node as well as a pointer to the previous node. This allows for traversal in both directions.
Sentinel Linked List: In a sentinel linked list, the head of the list is not a node containing data. Instead, the head is a "sentinel" node that is used to simplify certain operations. For example, you can insert a new node at the beginning of the list without having to check whether the list is empty.
