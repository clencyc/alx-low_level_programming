4. Add node at the end: Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.
5. Free list: Write a function that frees a dlistint_t list.
6. Get node at index: Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.
7. Sum list: Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.
8. Insert at index: Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
9. Delete at index: Write a function that deletes the node at a given index.
