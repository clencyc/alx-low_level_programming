Singly linked lists are a fundamental data structure used in computer programming. They consist of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains an element and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the head, and the last node is called the tail, with the tail pointing to a null reference.

Singly linked lists are commonly used because they allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position in the list. However, accessing an element in the middle of the list can be slower than accessing an element in an array, as each node must be traversed until the desired element is found.

Singly linked lists can be used to implement other data structures, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables. They can also be used to represent a sequence of operations or events in an application.

In this Directory, you will find a simple implementation of a singly linked list in C, along with examples of how to use it. The code uses dynamic memory allocation to create and delete nodes, and includes functions to add, remove, and search for elements in the list.
