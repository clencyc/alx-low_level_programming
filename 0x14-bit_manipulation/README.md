In C programming language, bit manipulation is a technique used to manipulate individual bits of a data type at the bit level. This technique is often used in systems programming and low-level operations that require efficient memory management and optimization.

Bitwise Operators
In C, there are six bitwise operators that can be used for bit manipulation:

1. & (AND): sets each bit to 1 if both corresponding bits are 1
2. | (OR): sets each bit to 1 if either corresponding bit is 1
3. ^ (XOR): sets each bit to 1 if only one of the corresponding bits is 1
4. ~ (NOT): inverts all the bits of the operand
5. << (left shift): shifts the bits of the operand to the left by the specified number of positions
6. >> (right shift): shifts the bits of the operand to the right by the specified number of positions
